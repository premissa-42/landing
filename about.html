    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p><strong>42</strong> is a 60m² modular space inside the <strong>Premissa Community Center</strong> in Ponta Delgada, São Miguel (Azores). It’s equipped with digital tools like VR headsets and projection gear — and most activities are free, designed especially for youth and marginalized communities, with a focus on LGBTQ+ inclusion.</p>
    <p>We host exhibitions, workshops, and immersive experiences — and bring global content to the island through open digital formats.</p>
    <p>The project is run by <a href="premissa.html" style="color: #9e8cff;">PAA – Premissa Açores Associação</a>, with support from <strong>Jovens+</strong> and <strong>Drac-RJAAC</strong>.</p>

    <p>From yoga and beach clean-ups to digital art labs and queer archives, Premissa is a constellation of connection in São Miguel.</p>
